# This module is intentionally left minimal for now.
# It can be extended with experimental or specialized distance functions
# that don't fit into other categories.

# Placeholder for future experimental functions
# Example functions that could be added:
# - Custom distance metrics
# - Domain-specific distance measures
# - Utility helper functions
